    <h2>Assignment 3: Building a Web Site</h2>
    <h3>Winter 2020</h3>
    <h4>Due date: April 16, 2020, <span class="important">before 9 AM</span></h4></div>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you have to continue developping your Flask application you created in
    your previous assignments.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ol>
    <li>All your forms should be defined as subclasses of <code>FlaskForm</code>, and should have properly defined
        validators. Your forms should be handled properly, by defining a route accepting GET and POST methods, and
        you should use the POST/REDIRECT/GET pattern when the form data validates (as shown in class).
    </li>
    <li>Your web site data should be stored in files, located in the
        <code>data</code> subfolder.  The data should in CSV or JSON formats. 
        Alternatively, you can store your data in an SQLite DB, also stored in the
        <code>data</code> subfolder, or in some other DB. Storing data in a database is optional.
    </li>
    <li>Your web site should contain:
        <ol>
            <li>At least 2 forms, with at least one of these forms which must be significantly different from the ones
                included in the examples covered in class and in the tutorials.
            </li>
            <li>At least 1 table and at least 1 list created dynamically from data stored in a
                local file or a local SQLite DB (or some other DB). These pages can be, or not, directly connected
                to your forms.
            </li>
            <li>A way to support user logins. Note that logging in can be limited to administrators, thus there's no
                need to have a registration page (but you can have a registration page if you wish). Make sure you
                provide a valid username/password pair to allow using
                your web site if you don't have a registration page and/or if some features are limited to already
                created users (such as admins). Some pages should be protected and viewable by only the logged in
                users. There should be a way, in each page, to figure out if a user is logged in or not. You could
                have a special <code>div</code> in your base template that displays whether a user is logged in or not.
            </li>
            <li>At least 3 of the following features:
                <ol>
                    <li>JavaScript input or form validation, using regular expressions where appropriate, on at least 2
                        forms.
                    </li>
                    <li>JavaScript Ajax call(s) to dynamically load data from the server, and the server code to
                        support it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using a database instead of local files to store data.</li>
                    <li>A <em>Forgot password</em> page to help reset a user's <strong>lost</strong> password.</li>
                    <li>A search page (or possibly a <code>div</code> in a block shared among your templates) to search
                        for something interesting on your site (for example, search for some blog posts).
                    </li>
                    <li>Some other advanced feature, going beyond the basic examples presented in class and in the
                        tutorials, including, but not limited to
                        <ol>
                        	<li>More advanced user interface (more professional design, with animations, ... , using external JS libraries or other tricks)</li>
                        	<li>A RESTful API for your web site</li>
                        	<li>Using external APIs to connect to other web sites (like using the Facebook API for example)</li>
                        	<li>The ability to send emails from your web site</li>
                        	<li>More advanced session mangement (tracking, user statistics, ...)</li>
                        	<li>Role-based access control or other more adbvanced user permissions management</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

            overview of your web site, go through the different pages, demo the features (log in, submit forms,
            additional features, etc...). You will also have to answer at least one question from the TA. Your answer(s) will
            be graded. Your demo, not counting the time for questions and answers, should take no more than 5
            minutes.
